### Project Purpose

This project is dedicated to sharing custom color themes that I've designed with others:

* To use as additional designs in their preferred IDE
* And/or clone & modify for their own purposes

<a href="project-purpose"></a>
### Contribution Guidelines

I would be immensely grateful for contributions pertaining to [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs) & proposing [Feature Requests](#feature-requests).

To align with the [Project Purpose](#project-purpose) mentioned in previous section, the project is **_NOT_** dedicated to becoming a collection of themes from external sources. Please do not submit color themes (I'm sure they're top-notch designs though!).

Thank you in advance for taking the time to submit your contributions!
