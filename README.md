# Themes

This project is a continuously expanding collection of custom IDE color themes that I've designed, and a resource for others to enjoy using in their own environments.

# <a href="installation">Installation</a>

* Select an IDE's respective directory (e.g., [quiver](/quiver)).
* Within that IDE's directory, select a theme to install (e.g., [calm](/quiver/calm/)).
* Within that theme's directory, download the configuration file (e.g., [Calm.json](/quiver/calm/Calm.json)).

# <a href="usage">Usage</a>

Usage will vary dependent on the IDE selected. Review its respective README.md. to use the theme's configuration file.
